  <h1>Nexa Linux - Development ISO images</h1>
</div>

After working on a lot of things related to the distribution, we have been tired of keeping it not out for so long, so we have decided to start releasing development ISO's! ðŸŽ‰

## We have to warn you, we do NOT RECOMMEND maining these ISO's!
These ISO images are highly unstable as they are meant to be used for development. You're on your own if you break anything.
